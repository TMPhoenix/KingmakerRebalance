# Call of the Wild

This is Pathfinder: Kingmaker mod.

- Starting from version 1.57 the mod is no longer compatible with Eldritch Arcana.
- If you are using mod version prior to 1.57 (or no mod at all) and have characters who are polymorphed, wait till polymorph effect expires.
- Save games with primal companion hunter, are no longer compatible, so respec out of the archetype is required prior to 1.68 update.
- If you have animal companions with animal growth buff, wait till it expires, before updating to 1.68
- If you have characters with Quicken Blessing feat, respec them so they do not have it, before updating to 1.72,
- Advanced fighter training options from 1.77 are not compatible with Advanced Martial Arts Mod, you can deactivate them if you prefer the latter.
- Wizard Discoveries from 1.81 might conflict with those from The Lost Grimoire Mod, you can disable them in setting.json.

Mod is only expected to work with  2.08 English version of Enhanced Edition of the game.

Known Issues:
- Sometimes when playing Hunter/Summoner, companion abilities (animal foci, teamwork feats, fiendish or celestial templates, evolutions) might disappear after level up. It seems that deactivating all companion abilities (like power attack) and saving the game (no need to reload)  brings all missing abilities back. Same issue happens with newly created mercenaries, it resolves itself when you leave the capital/varnhold/trading post or enter the endless dungeon.
- If you start summoner/primal companion hunter level-up and then abort the process, your eidolon will lose all of its evolutions and will not regain them until you finish level-up.
